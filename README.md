### **_About BingeWatch_**

I have been an avid user of Letterboxd, a social media site for movies. I noticed many people lamenting that there is no fully functional way to add TV shows as you want. Enter BingeWatch.

No longer do you have to worry about whether you will be able to add your favorite TV show to a database. With BingeWatch, you can review shows, find reviews that other registered users have added as well as delete your own reviws.
